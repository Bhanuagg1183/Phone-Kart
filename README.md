# Phone-Kart

Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Machine Learning, Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

Developed a regression-based machine learning model to predict mobile phone prices based on technical specifications such as RAM, storage, battery capacity, camera quality, and screen size. Conducted thorough data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis to identify key price-driving features. Trained models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, achieving an RÂ² score of over 0.90 using Random Forest Regressor. Optimized model performance through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. Visualized prediction trends and feature importances to enhance interpretability.
